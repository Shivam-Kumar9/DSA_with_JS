stack memory / call stack

- in this  function  and  primitive data stored

=> heap memory 
-   and reference data stored  / non-primitive data stored


* stack memory is small and fast
* heap memory is large and slow
 5 / 95   data stored in stack and heap memory
* a function create it own memory in stack
* when function call another function, it create a new memory in stack or variable is stored in stack 


\\recursion -  a function call itself again and again until a base condition is met

* recursive fun ke baad jo bhe  code ha wo back tracking jab fun call-stack se pop ho raha ho tab execute  hota ha
